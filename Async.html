    //=============Question: give three way i can make my code asynchronous in JS===========================================//

    //------------ANSWER-------------------------------------------//
    //Sure, here are three common ways to make your code asynchronous in JavaScript:

    // 1)  Using callbacks: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when the operation is completed.
    //     You can use callbacks to simulate asynchronous operations in JavaScript.For example, you can use the setTimeout function to delay the execution 
    //     of a function and provide a callback function that will be executed after the delay.
    //     Here's an example:

    function simulateAsyncOperation(callback) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        callback("Result of async operation");
      }, 1000);
    }

    console.log("Before async operation");

    simulateAsyncOperation(function (result) {
      console.log("Async operation completed with result:", result);
    });
    console.log("After async operation");


    // 2)  Using Promises: Promises provide a more elegant way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
    //     A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation, 
    //     and allows you to attach callbacks that will be executed when the operation is completed.
    //     Here's an example:


    function simulateAsyncOperation() {
      return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function () {
          resolve("Result of async operation");
        }, 1000);
      });
    }

    console.log("Before async operation");

    simulateAsyncOperation().then(function (result) {
      console.log("Async operation completed with result:", result);
    });

    console.log("After async operation");


    // 3)  Using async / await: Async / await is a modern syntax for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and is built on top of Promises.
    //     The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to wait for the completion of a Promise.
    //     Here's an example:

    async function simulateAsyncOperation() {
      return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function () {
          resolve("Result of async operation");
        }, 1000);
      });
    }
    async function run() {
      console.log("Before async operation");

      const result = await simulateAsyncOperation();

      console.log("Async operation completed with result:", result);

      console.log("After async operation");
    }
    run();
